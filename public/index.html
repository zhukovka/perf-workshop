<h1>Long Tasks API</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/">Long Tasks API</a> is useful for knowing when the browser's main
    thread is blocked for long enough to affect frame rate or input latency. Currently the API will report any tasks
    that execute for longer than 50 milliseconds (ms).</p>
<p>Anytime you need to run expensive code (or load and execute large scripts) it's useful to track whether or not that
    code blocked the main thread. In fact, many higher-level metrics are built on top of the Long Tasks API themselves
    (such as <a href="/interactive/">Time to Interactive (TTI)</a> and <a href="/lighthouse-total-blocking-time/">Total
        Blocking Time (TBT)</a>).</p>
