<h1>User Timing API</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/user-timing/">User Timing API</a> is your general purpose measurement API for
    time-based metrics. It allows you to arbitrarily mark points in time and then later measure the duration between
    those marks.</p>
<p>While APIs like <code>Date.now()</code> or <code>performance.now()</code> give you similar abilities, the benefit of
    using the User Timing API is it integrates well with performance tooling. For example, Chrome DevTools visualizes <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/04/devtools#tabs">User Timing measurements in the
        Performance panel</a>, and many analytics providers will also automatically track any measurements you make and
    send the duration data to their analytics back end.</p>
