<h1>Resource Timing API</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/">Resource Timing API</a> gives developers detailed insight into
    how resources for a particular page were loaded. Despite the name of the API, the information it provides is not
    just limited to timing data (though there's <a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#processing-model">plenty
        of that</a>). Other data you can access includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#dom-performanceresourcetiming-initiatortype">initiatorType</a>:
        how the resource was fetched: such as from a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag, or
        from <code>fetch()</code></li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#dom-performanceresourcetiming-nexthopprotocol">nextHopProtocol</a>:
        the protocol used to fetch the resource, such as <code>h2</code> or <code>quic</code></li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#dom-performanceresourcetiming-encodedbodysize">encodedBodySize</a>/<a
            href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#dom-performanceresourcetiming-decodedbodysize">decodedBodySize</a>]:
        the size of the resource in its encoded or decoded form (respectively)
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#dom-performanceresourcetiming-transfersize">transferSize</a>:
        the size of the resource that was actually transferred over the network. When resources are fulfilled via the
        cache, this value can be much smaller than the <code>encodedBodySize</code>, and in some cases it can be zero
        (if no cache revalidation is required).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Note, you can use the <code>transferSize</code> property of resource timing entries to measure a <em>cache hit
    rate</em> metric or perhaps even a <em>total cached resource size</em> metric, which may be useful in understanding
    how your resource caching strategy affects performance for repeat visitors.</p>
