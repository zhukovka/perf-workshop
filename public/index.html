<h1>Element Timing API</h1>
<p>
    The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric is useful for knowing when the largest image or text block was painted to
    the screen, but in some cases you want to measure the render time of a different element.
</p>
<p>
    For these cases, you can use the Element Timing API. In fact, the Largest Contentful Paint API is actually built on
    top of the Element Timing API and adds automatic reporting of the largest contentful element, but you can report on
    additional elements by explicitly adding the <code>elementtiming</code> attribute to them, and registering a
    PerformanceObserver
    to observe the element entry type.
