<h1>Event Timing API</h1>
<p>The <a href="/fid/">First Input Delay (FID)</a> metric measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page
    to the time when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction.
    However, in some cases it may also be useful to measure the event processing time itself as well as the time until
    the next frame can be rendered.</p>
<p>This is possible with the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/event-timing/">Event Timing API</a> (which is used to
    measure FID) as it exposes a number of timestamps in the event lifecycle, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/#dom-performanceentry-starttime"><code>startTime</code></a>:
        the time when the browser receives the event.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://wicg.github.io/event-timing/#dom-performanceeventtiming-processingstart"><code>processingStart</code></a>:
        the time when the browser is able to begin processing event handlers for the event.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://wicg.github.io/event-timing/#dom-performanceeventtiming-processingend"><code>processingEnd</code></a>:
        time when the browser finishes executing all synchronous code initiated from event handlers for this event.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://wicg.github.io/event-timing/#dom-performanceeventtiming-processingstart"><code>duration</code></a>:
        the time (rounded to 8ms for security reasons) between when the browser receives the event until it's able to
        paint the next frame after finishing executing all synchronous code initiated from the event handlers.
    </li>
</ul>
